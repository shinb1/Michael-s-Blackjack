1. The betting part of my code doesn't really work so I left it out of my code. I couldn't get it to place a bet, minimum bet, etc. 
2. The best single feature of my program would have to be the shuffling of the deck. It's really simple but it was super hard to get as it took like 3 days trying to get it correct and have it not repeat any numbers or face cards. 
3. In a complicated program, classes in Java become real handy because of the fact that they can be accessed by other classes, so basically, it's something where a class can pull another one from somewhere.
4. In private, only a specific class can access it. 
5. Class methods can be called upon without creating an initial instance of the class whereas instance methods require an instance of the class before they can be called upon.
6. Essentially, inheritance is when you want to create a new class but there are bits of code that already exists in another class, you can make your new class from the existing class, saving time and it makes it easier to read. 
7. Super is used to refer to a parent class. This refers to the object in which its method is called upon.
8. State and behaviorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
9. THe only thing that really confuses me now is organizing everything together so it becomes more clear for me to see what I'm coding and such. It becomes a pain if I haven't organized my code and suddenly bits of my code don't work, like the shuffle part of my deck.
